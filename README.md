## Indicator Inputs
The EA uses the following input parameters:

- FastMA_Period: Fast Moving Average Period
- SlowMA_Period: Slow Moving Average Period
- RSI_Period: RSI Period
- RSI_Overbought_Level: RSI Overbought Level
- RSI_Oversold_Level: RSI Oversold Level

## Functionality
The EA is designed to execute buy and sell trades based on the following conditions:

1. If the fast moving average (MA) is greater than the slow MA and the RSI is above the overbought level, a buy trade is executed.
2. If the fast MA is less than the slow MA and the RSI is below the oversold level, a sell trade is executed.
3. If none of the above conditions are met, no trading action is taken.

For each executed trade, the EA sets a stop loss and take profit level, and prints the execution details including the trade price.

## Implementation Details
The EA uses various built-in MQL5 functions to retrieve market data and perform calculations. Here are the main functions used in the code:

- `MarketInfo(Symbol(), MODE_BID)`: Retrieves the current bid price of the symbol.
- `iMA(Symbol(), PERIOD_CURRENT, FastMA_Period, 0, MODE_EMA, PRICE_CLOSE, 0)`: Calculates the fast moving average using the exponential moving average (EMA) method.
- `iMA(Symbol(), PERIOD_CURRENT, SlowMA_Period, 0, MODE_EMA, PRICE_CLOSE, 0)`: Calculates the slow moving average using the EMA method.
- `iRSI(Symbol(), PERIOD_CURRENT, RSI_Period, PRICE_CLOSE, 0)`: Calculates the RSI using the closing prices.

The EA also uses the `OrderSend()` function to execute trades. It sets the trade type, lot size, stop loss, take profit, and order comment.
